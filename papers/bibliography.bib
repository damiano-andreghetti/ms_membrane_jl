abstract = {Abstract The biological membrane, which compartmentalizes the cell and its organelles, exhibits wide variety of macroscopic shapes of varying morphology and topology. A systematic understanding of the relation of membrane shapes to composition, external field, environmental conditions, etc. have important biological relevance. Here we review the triangulated surface model, used in the macroscopic simulation of membranes and the associated DTMC methods. New techniques to calculate surface quantifiers, that will facilitate the study of additional in-plane orientational degrees of freedom, has been introduced. The mere presence of a polar and nematic fields, in the ordered phase, drives the ground state conformations of the membrane to a cylinder and tetrahedron, respectively.},

abstract = {The conformation and scaling properties of self-avoiding fluid membranes with an extrinsic bending rigidity κ were studied with the use of Monte Carlo methods. For κ = 0, the results are consistent with branched polymer behavior at large length scales. There is a smooth crossover from a crumpled to an extended state with increasing κ, with a peak in the specific heat when the persistence length reaches the system size. The scale-dependent effective bending rigidity is a decreasing function of system size for all bare rigidities. These results indicate that fluid membranes are always crumpled at sufficiently long length scales.}}

A kinetic law of exchange between the membrane and the fluid is introduced. It is shown that the membrane may become morphologically unstable. In the stable regime the fluctuations kinetics are analyzed. Diffusion as well as desorption lead to dynamical laws for the fluctuation width which assumes different scaling laws with time (e.g., t1/2, tln (t),…) depending on the prevailing dissipation mechanism. The experimental analysis of dynamical fluctuations should give access to the microscopic physical parameters.}

abstract = {It is known that giant vesicles undergo dynamic morphological changes when exposed to a detergent. The solubilization process may take multiple pathways. In this work, we identify lipid vesicle shape dynamics before the solubilization of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine giant vesicles with Triton X-100 (TR) detergent. The violent lipid vesicle dynamics was observed with laser confocal scanning microscopy and was qualitatively explained via a numerical simulation. A three-dimensional Monte Carlo scheme was constructed that emulated the nonequilibrium conditions at the beginning stages of solubilization, accounting for a gradual addition of TR detergent molecules into the lipid bilayers. We suggest that the main driving factor for morphology change in lipid vesicles is the associative tendency of the TR molecules, which induces spontaneous curvature of the detergent inclusions, an intrinsic consequence of their molecular shape. The majority of the observed lipid vesicle shapes in the experiments were found to correspond very well to the numerically calculated shapes in the phase space of possible solutions. The results give an insight into the early stages of lipid vesicle solubilization by amphiphilic molecules, which is nonequilibrium in nature and very difficult to study.}

abstract="In this review, we describe and analyze a mesoscale simulation method for fluid flow, which was introduced by Malevanets and Kapral in 1999, and is now called multi-particle collision dynamics (MPC) or stochastic rotation dynamics (SRD). The method consists of alternating streaming and collision steps in an ensemble of point particles. The multi-particle collisions are performed by grouping particles in collision cells, and mass, momentum, and energy are locally conserved. This simulation technique captures both full hydrodynamic interactions and thermal fluctuations. The first part of the review begins with a description of several widely used MPC algorithms and then discusses important features of the original SRD algorithm and frequently used variations. Two complementary approaches for deriving the hydrodynamic equations and evaluating the transport coefficients are reviewed. It is then shown how MPC algorithms can be generalized to model non-ideal fluids, and binary mixtures with a consolute point. The importance of angular-momentum conservation for systems like phase-separated liquids with different viscosities is discussed. The second part of the review describes a number of recent applications of MPC algorithms to study colloid and polymer dynamics, the behavior of vesicles and cells in hydrodynamic flows, and the dynamics of vis-coelastic fluids.",

abstract = {Clustering of extracellular ligands and proteins on the plasma membrane is required to perform specific cellular functions, such as signaling and endocytosis. Attractive forces that originate in perturbations of the membrane’s physical properties contribute to this clustering, in addition to direct protein–protein interactions. However, these membrane-mediated forces have not all been equally considered, despite their importance. In this review, we describe how line tension, lipid depletion, and membrane curvature contribute to membrane-mediated clustering. Additional attractive forces that arise from protein-induced perturbation of a membrane’s fluctuations are also described. This review aims to provide a survey of the current understanding of membrane-mediated clustering and how this supports precise biological functions.}

abstract="Interactions mediated by the cell membrane between inclusions, such as membrane proteins or antimicrobial peptides, play important roles in their biological activity. They also constitute a fascinating challenge for physicists, since they test the boundaries of our understanding of self-assembled lipid membranes, which are remarkable examples of two-dimensional complex fluids. Inclusions can couple to various degrees of freedom of the membrane, resulting in different types of interactions. In this chapter, we review the membrane-mediated interactions that arise from direct constraints imposed by inclusions on the shape of the membrane. These effects are generic and do not depend on specific chemical interactions. Hence, they can be studied using coarse-grained soft matter descriptions. We deal with long-range membrane-mediated interactions due to the constraints imposed by inclusions on membrane curvature and on its fluctuations. We also discuss the shorter-range interactions that arise from the constraints on membrane thickness imposed by inclusions presenting a hydrophobic mismatch with the membrane.",
