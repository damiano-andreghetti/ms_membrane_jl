here fluctuating membrane is a plane described above a square lattice L * L.\n
We have:
1) Membrane moves: membrane is updated towards equilibrium through monte carlo
2) Particle moves: particle diffuse through kawasaki MC moves
3) Insertion: particles are inserted with probability $k_I$ in empty sites
4) Extraction: clusters of particles of size $\geq N_e$ are removed with probability 1
\n
Notice that moves 3 and 4 bring the system out of equilibrium towards a stationary state.
